# Remote-Control-Car
The aim of this project was to make a remote controlled car that uses Arduino and which can
be operated using mobile device using Bluetooth module.\
This project helps increases your understanding in using Arduino and how Bluetooth module is
used to send signals and how motor shield gets instructions and how they works on motors to
move in correct direction.\
##This Project covers the following implementations:\
  • Moving car in all directions i.e. Forward ,Backward, Right, Left, Forward-Right, Forward-
Left, Backward-Right, Backward-Left.\
  • Varying speed of car from 100 to 255..\
 \
##Component used:\
Following Components our included in our RC car.\
  1. Arduino Uno\
  2. Motor Sheild L293D\
  3. Bluetooth Module HC-05\
  4. Car Kit (4Tyre, Frame)\
  5. 4 DC Motors\
  6. Jumper Wires (Male to Female, Male to Male)\
  7. Battery (made from 3 Li-on 3.7 V cells)\
  8. Android Device (For operating car)\
